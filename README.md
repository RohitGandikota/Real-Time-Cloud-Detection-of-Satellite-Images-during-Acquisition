# Real-Time-Cloud-Detection-of-Satellite-Images-during-Acquisition
This project deals with the real time cloud detection of the ongoing acquisition data of satellite images. For this end, we use a simple and light MLP for classification of the image pixels. This work can classify the satellite images of size ranges till 64000 pixels width.
