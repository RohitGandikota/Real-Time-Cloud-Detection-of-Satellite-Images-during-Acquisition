# Real-Time-Cloud-Detection-of-Satellite-Images-during-Acquisition
This project deals with the real time cloud detection of the ongoing acquisition data of satellite images. For this end, we use a simple and light MLP for classification of the image pixels. This work can classify the satellite images of size ranges till 64000 pixels width. 
Since, the directly acquired data is in binary format and is not corrected athmosphericaly, geometrically or radiometrically, we use fred_reader.py to read the data in a predefined format. Later we use the DN2TOA.py to correct the radiometric anomolies. To remove the sun position during the image acquisition as a factor, we predict the sun position based on the time and remove the illumination in that direction. This helps in normalising the illumination such that the imaging area on earth, the satellite imaging sensor and the sun are on the same line. 
Finally after acquisition of the real time data, we pass it through a pretrained network (the information about this training is defined in another repository of mine). The final output is displayed simultaneously along with the acquired satellite data.
